QInvasion
=========

Invasion mod for native Quake

A mod I made for Quake for some mindless cooperative onslaught.

To use this, you need a custom map with the following entities and properties:

inv_controller
  wave_limit: How many waves to carry out
  
inv_spawn
  wave_N_monsterName: How many of monsters to spawn per wave.  wave_0_zombie:10 will spawn 10 zombies the first wave for the given entity.
